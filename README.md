# fractal-image-compression

A very simple implementation of fractal image compression.

If you want to know more about fractal image compression or understand the code. I suggest you to read [Fractal and Wavelet Image Compression Techniques](https://spie.org/publications/book/353798?print=2&SSO=1). 

## Examples

The script can compress and decompress greyscale images.

![Iterations of the decompression of a greyscale image](https://github.com/pvigier/fractal-image-compression/raw/master/examples/monkey.png)

But also RGB images by applying the algorithm to the three channels.
